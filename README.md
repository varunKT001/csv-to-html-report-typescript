# 📁 CSV -> HTML Report

This is project is made for learning the difference between **inheritance** based approach or a **composition** based approach.

## What it does 🤔?

It takes a **`.csv`** file, containing records of football matches over the year, as an input. It then parses the raw data into a better data structure. Following that, it analyzes the data and prints out a report either on the **console** or as a **`.html`** file.

## Key takeaways 🧠

- Both are design patterns used for the purpose of code re-use.

- Inheritance => **Is a** Relationship (A `Rectancgle` **is a** `Shape`).

- Composition => **Has/Have a** Relationship (A `Laptop` **has a** `Cpu`).

## So, what's better 📈

In numerous scenarios **Composition** using the **Delegation pattern** works **better** in terms of code re-use and avoid code duplication to a great extent.

That's just my **personal opinion**..._please don't cancel me_ 🙂
